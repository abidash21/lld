KISS( Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- Simplicity in design and implementation

Features:
- Improved readability
- Ease of maintenance
- Lower risk of errors
- Faster development
- Better colllaboration

Implementation:
- Break down problems
- Avoid over engineering
- Use clear naming conventions
- Leverage established design patterns
- Write modular code

Advantages:
- Enhanced readability
- Faster debugging
- Improved collaboration
- Reduced maintenance cost 
- Quicker development

Disadvantage:
- Limited Flexibility: Keeping things overly simple may result in designs that cannot easily accommodate future changes or scalability.
- Potential Oversimplification: Striving for simplicity can sometimes lead to missing critical edge cases or ignoring valid requirements.
- Misinterpretation of Simplicity: Developers might prioritize minimal lines of code over clarity, resulting in compact but unreadable solutions.
- Resistance to Innovation: Adhering strictly to simplicity may discourage the use of advanced techniques or frameworks that could optimize performance.
