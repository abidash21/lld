Behavioral Design Patterns
- Enhancing communication between objects
- Defines how object collaborates to complete a task
- Manage the flow of control between objects efficiently
- Ensure structured & organized communication, reducing chaos

advantages:
- Clearer communication
- Decoupling objects
- Flexibility
- Better organization

TYpes of behavioural design pattern:
1. Observer Pattern
- when something important happends all the subscribers get notfied in real time
- ex: Social Media Newsfeed

2. Strategy Pattern
- Different game plan for different situations
- Switch between strategies dynamically depending on the context
- ex:

3. Command Pattern

- ex:

4. Chain of Responsibility Pattern 
- Requests travels through a chain until they reach at the right handler
- ex:

5. Mediator Pattern
- Instead of everyone talking to each other directly, all communication goes through a mediator
- ex:

6. State Pattern
- The object's behaviour changes dynamically based on its state
- ex:

7. Template Method Pattern
- Ensures consistency while allowing flexibility
- ex: A receipe provides a fixed structure, but you can customize some steps

8. Iterator Pattern
- Iterate through a collection without worrying about how it is structured
- ex:

9. Visitor Pattern
- Allows new operations to be added to objects without modifying the structure
- Extends functionality without changing existing code
- ex:

10. Memento Pattern
- Allows to capture object's state and restore it later
- ex: undo features and rollback functionality
