Ex: Movie ticket booking system

features - Seat Selection, Payment Processing, Ticket Generation

=> Class Diagram is requried to describe essential components of a system , which will be refered to unerstand how
   LLD principles are applied in practice

=> HLD and LLD are two stages of software development

=> HLD focuses on overall architecture of the system i.e.user interface, backend services, database and
   the flow of data or components interactions.

=> LLD focuses on implementation of this features. It specifies how data is validated, algorithm for an feature and
   how the information is stored in DB. It describes the flow of data, creating blueprints for each transaction in 
   the system, to ensure reliablity and precision.

=> Activity Diagram - describes the process flow and how individual actions contribute to achieving the desired functionality
   

1. Requirement Gatherings: 
- Identify the functionality, constraints, edge cases to ensure the design meets use needs
- i.e. Seat Seleciton, Payment Processing, Ticket Generation

2. Laying Down UseCase:
- Define specific scenerios that the system will handle outlining inputs, actions and expected outputs
- Helps in clarifying the scope and guiding the design process
- i.e. Booking tickets for a single user, Handling group booking with seat proximity, Cancellation, Notification for booking confirmation

3. UML(Unified Modelling Language) Diagrams:
- Create diagram to visually represent the structure, behavior and interactions of system components
- i.e. class diagram, sequence diagram, activity diagram

4. Model Problems:
- Solving specific problems identified during the usecase analysis
- Breaking down the system into smaller components and addressing the individual design challenges
- Design patterns is helpful in this page, offering reusable solutions to common design problems
- i.e. Factory Design Pattern, Strategy Design Pattern, Observer Design Pattern

5. Implement Code: 
- Translate the design into clean, modular and efficient code adhering to coding standards and principles.
- i.e. SOLID, DRY



** How to approach LLD Interview **
Evaluation to design software system 
  1. Class structure
  2. Desgin patterns
  3. Relationships
  4. implementation Details

- Clarify Requirements and usecases
- Writing core flow
- Identify entity out of core flow
- Relationship between entities
- Write code for basic entities
- Identify core methods for each class and concurrency Handling
- Desgin Pattern to use
- Implement necessary methods
- Exception Handling
